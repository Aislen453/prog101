A list of 4-5 assignments/Projects I have completed
<h1>Adventure Game</h1>
You have made it back to your friends village when suddenly you see that the village has been stuck in a non
	ending night and your friends and villagers are in need of your help. Your mission is to get through puzzles and
	find the potion in order to take back time to normal. Can you do it?
<h3>In this game you have to make sure you choose the correct paths to go through in order to find the right items which will eventually lead you to the potion</h3>

<h1>Adopt a Fish</h1>
In this game you get to adopt a fish and be able to see the information about it once you adopt it such as changing its name and color and being able to adopt more fish.

<h1>Frog Learning Education Application</h1>
Done in WPF with c# where user can learn about 4 different types of frogs and be able to click through them or go back in them as well as being able to name/adopt a frog at the end of the application with the choices being one of the four frogs that were talked about in the application. It was pretty difficult as it was newer learning but It was overall a fun experience.

<h1>Hello World</h1>
This was a small excercise where you get ASCCI Art in the beggining saying "Hello world" as long with user being asked to input their name and once input the name is told back to them.

<h1>Pyramid practice</h1>
This was harder for me to do as it was being able to make a pyramid out of theese "***" But I was only able to do half a pyramid and not a full on both sides pyramid but overall it was fun to do and very interesting on my end.
