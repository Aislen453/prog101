A list of 4-5 assignments/Projects I have completed
<h1>Adventure Game</h1>
You have made it back to your friends village when suddenly you see that the village has been stuck in a non
	ending night and your friends and villagers are in need of your help. Your mission is to get through puzzles and
	find the potion in order to take back time to normal. Can you do it?
<h3>In this game you have to make sure you choose the correct paths to go through in order to find the right items which will eventually lead you to the potion</h3>
